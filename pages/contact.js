    <p>The Norman Gershman Photographic Archive was established in the summer of 2021 and is housed in Montpelier, Vermont; The Archive contains all of the works of Norman Gershman. While still in its formative stages as the Archive is organized, printing of newly rediscovered work is already underway.</p>
    <p>PRE-ORDERS will soon be available and each month&apos;s more prints will be added to the available list as they are properly evaluated and prepared.</p>
    <p>Should you be interested in any particular image you see in the Archives, please do let us know. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
