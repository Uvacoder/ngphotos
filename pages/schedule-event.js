      <p>The BESA exhibit has been touring the world for over a decade. Now, your organization can request the BESA show to be used for a night or even a week of fundraising efforts for your unique organization. The message of the show is simple and clear: Religious tolerance is at the center of world peace.</p>

      <p>Imagine inviting persons of all faiths to your event for an evening of religious tolerance.  Included in your package will be a &lsquo;ready to print&rsquo; photographic collection of 18 images, featuring righteous Muslim families who saved Jews during World War II. You will also receive a 40 minute film, entitled “BESA: the Promise,” as well as story notes. For more information on this, contact us at info@normangershman.com</p>
